              <b>1. Weak AI or Narrow AI:</b><br>
              <li>Narrow AI is a type of AI which is able to perform a dedicated task with
                intelligence. The most common and currently available AI is Narrow AI in the
                world of Artificial Intelligence.</li>
              <li>Narrow AI cannot perform beyond its field or limitations, as it is only trained for
                one specific task. Hence it is also termed as weak AI. Narrow AI can fail in
                unpredictable ways if it goes beyond its limits.</li>
              <li>Apple Siri is a good example of Narrow AI, but it operates with a limited predefined range of functions.</li>
              <li> IBM's Watson supercomputer also comes under Narrow AI, as it uses an Expert
                system approach combined with Machine learning and natural language processing.</li>
              <li>Some Examples of Narrow AI are Google translate, playing chess, purchasing
                suggestions on e-commerce sites, self-driving cars, speech recognition, and image
                recognition.</li>

             <b> 2. General AI:</b>
              <li>General AI is a type of intelligence that could perform any intellectual task with
                efficiency like a human.</li>
              <li>The idea behind the general AI to make such a system that could be smarter and
              think like a human on its own.</li>
              <li>Currently, there is no such system exists which could come under general AI and
                can perform any task as perfect as a human. It may arrive within the next 20 or so
                years but it has challenges relating to hardware, the energy consumption required
                in todayâ€™s powerful machines, and the need to solve for catastrophic memory loss
                that affects even the most advanced deep learning algorithms of today.</li>
              <li>The worldwide researchers are now focused on developing machines with General
                AI.</li>
              <li>As systems with general AI are still under research, and it will take lots of effort
                and time to develop such systems.</li> </div>

             <b> 3. Super AI:</b>
              <li>Super AI is a level of Intelligence of Systems at which machines could surpass
                human intelligence, and can perform any task better than a human with cognitive
                properties. This refers to aspects like general wisdom, problem solving and
                creativity. It is an outcome of general AI.</li>
              <li>Some key characteristics of strong AI include capability include the ability to think,
                to reason solve the puzzle, make judgments, plan, learn, and communicate on its
                own.</li>
              <li>Super AI is still a hypothetical concept of Artificial Intelligence. The development
                of such systems in real is still a world-changing task. </li>

              <b> 1. Reactive Machines</b>
              <li>Purely reactive machines are the most basic types of Artificial Intelligence.</li>
              <li> Such AI systems do not store memories or past experiences for future actions.</li>
              <li>These machines only focus on current scenarios and react on it as per possible best
                action.</li>
