              The Internet of Things has not been around for very long. However, there have been visions of
                           machines communicating with one another since the early 1800s. Machines have been providing
                           direct communications since the telegraph (the first landline) was developed in the 1830s and
                           1840s. Described as “wireless telegraphy,” the first radio voice transmission took place on June 3,
                           1900, providing another necessary component for developing the Internet of Things. The
                           development of computers began in the 1950s.<br><br>
                           The Internet, itself a significant component of the IoT, started out as part of DARPA (Defense
                           Advanced Research Projects Agency) in 1962 and evolved into ARPANET in 1969. In the 1980s,
                           commercial service providers began supporting public use of ARPANET, allowing it to evolve
                           into our modern Internet. Global Positioning Satellites (GPS) became a reality in early 1993, with
                           the Department of Defense providing a stable, highly functional system of 24 satellites. This was
                           quickly followed by privately owned, commercial satellites being placed in orbit. Satellites and
                           landlines provide basic communications for much of the IoT. One additional and important
                           component in developing a functional IoT was IPV6’s remarkably intelligent decision to increase
                           address space.<br><br>
                           The Internet of Things, as a concept, wasn’t officially named until 1999. One of the first examples
                           of an Internet of Things is from the early 1980s and was a Coca Cola machine, located at the
                           Carnegie Melon University. Local programmers would connect by the Internet to the refrigerated
                           appliance, and check to see if there was a drink available and if it was cold, before making the trip.<br><br>
                           By the year 2013, the Internet of Things had evolved into a system using multiple technologies,
                           ranging from the Internet to wireless communication and from micro-electromechanical systems
                           (MEMS) to embedded systems. The traditional fields of automation (including the automation of
                           buildings and homes), wireless sensor networks, GPS, control systems, and others, all support the
                           IoT.<br><br>
                           Kevin Ashton, the Executive Director of Auto-ID Labs at MIT, was the first to describe the Internet
                           of Things, during his 1999 speech. Kevin Ashton stated that Radio Frequency Identification
                           (RFID) was a prerequisite for the Internet of Things. He concluded if all devices were “tagged,”
                           computers could manage, track, and inventory them. To some extent, the tagging of things has
                           been achieved through technologies such as digital watermarking, barcodes, and QR codes.
                           Inventory control is one of the more obvious advantages of the Internet of Things.</div></div>
