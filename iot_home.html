        <h3><b>What is Internet of Things?</b></h3>
        <hr class="hori">
        <p> <b>The description of the Internet of Things is related to different definitions used by several groups
            for promoting the particular concept in the whole world.</b><br><br>
            <b>➢ According to the Internet Architecture Board’s (IAB)</b> definition, IoT is the networking of
            smart objects, meaning a huge number of devices intelligently communicating in the
            presence of internet protocol that cannot be directly operated by human beings but exist as
            components in buildings, vehicles or the environment.<br>
        <b>➢ According to the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) </b>organization’s definition, IoT is
            the networking of smart objects in which smart objects have some constraints such as
            limited bandwidth, power, and processing accessibility for achieving interoperability
            among smart objects.<br>
        <b>➢ According to the IEEE Communications category magazine’s </b>definition, IoT is a
            framework of all things that have a representation in the presence of the internet in such a
            way that new applications and services enable the interaction in the physical and virtual
            world in the form of Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication in the cloud.<br>
        <b>➢ According to the Oxford dictionary’s</b> definition, IoT is the interaction of everyday object’s
            computing devices through the Internet that enables the sending and receiving of useful
            data.<br>                      
        ➢ The term Internet of Things (IoT) according to the <b>2020 conceptual framework</b> is expressed
            through a simple formula such as:<br><br>
            <b style="text-align: center; margin-left: 30%; border: 4px dashed darkmagenta; padding: 10px;">
                IoT= Services+ Data+ Networks + Sensors</b>
        
        </p>
             
            <hr class="hori">    
            <h5 style="text-align: center;"><b>The most important features of IoT include artificial intelligence, connectivity, sensors, active
                engagement, and small device use. A brief review of these features is given below −</b></h5>
            <hr class="hori"> 
            <ul style="text-align: justify; padding:10px;">
                <li>
                    <b style="border: 3px dashed red; padding: 1px;">AI − </b>IoT essentially makes virtually anything “smart”, meaning it enhances every aspect
                    of life with the power of data collection, artificial intelligence algorithms, and networks.
                    This can mean something as simple as enhancing your refrigerator and cabinets to detect
                    when milk and your favorite cereal run low, and to then place an order with your preferred
                    grocery.
                </li>
                <li>
                <b style="border: 3px dashed red; padding: 1px;">Connectivity −</b> New enabling technologies for networking and specifically IoT
                    networking, mean networks are no longer exclusively tied to major providers. Networks
                    can exist on a much smaller and cheaper scale while still being practical. IoT creates these
                    small networks between its system devices. 
                </li>
                <li>
                <b style="border: 3px dashed red; padding: 1px;"> Sensors − </b>IoT loses its distinction without sensors. They act as defining instruments that
                    transform IoT from a standard passive network of devices into an active system capable
                    of real-world integration.
                </li>
                <li>
                <b style="border: 3px dashed red; padding: 1px;">Active Engagement −</b> Much of today's interaction with connected technology happens
                    through passive engagement. IoT introduces a new paradigm for active content, product,
                    or service engagement.
