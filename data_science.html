        <hr class="hori">
        
        <p> <b>Data science</b> is a multi-disciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and
          systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured, semi-structured and unstructured data.
         It is much more than simply analyzing data. It offers a range of roles and requires a
          range of skills.</p>

            <h4><b>What are data and information?</b></h4>
            <hr class="hori"> 
            <b>Data</b> can be defined as a representation of facts, concepts, or instructions in a formalized manner,
                which should be suitable for communication, interpretation, or processing, by human or electronic
                machines. It can be described as unprocessed facts and figures. It is represented with the help of
                characters such as alphabets (A-Z, a-z), digits (0-9) or special characters (+, -, /, *, <,>, =, etc.).
               <br><br> Whereas <b>information</b> is the processed data on which decisions and actions are based. It is data that
                has been processed into a form that is meaningful to the recipient and is of real or perceived value
                in the current or the prospective action or decision of recipient. Furtherer more, information is
                interpreted data; created from organized, structured, and processed data in a particular context.</p>
                <h4><b>Data Processing Cycle</b></h4>
                <hr class="hori"> 
                <p>Data processing is the re-structuring or re-ordering of data by people or machines to increase their
                    usefulness and add values for a particular purpose. Data processing consists of the following basic
                    steps - input, processing, and output. These three steps constitute the data processing cycle.

                    <div class="container">

                        <div class="card " style="border: 2px double red; background-color: rgb(0, 255, 255);">
                          <div class="card-body">
                            <p class="card-text"><b>Input −</b> in this step, the input data is prepared in some convenient form for processing. The
                              form will depend on the processing machine. For example, when electronic computers are
                              24
                              used, the input data can be recorded on any one of the several types of storage medium,
                              such as hard disk, CD, flash disk and so on.
                            </p>

                             <b>Processing −</b>  in this step, the input data is changed to produce data in a more useful form.
                      For example, interest can be calculated on deposit to a bank, or a summary of sales for the
                      month can be calculated from the sales orders.

                              <b>Output − </b>at this stage, the result of the proceeding processing step is collected. The
                          particular form of the output data depends on the use of the data. For example, output data
                          may be payroll for employees.

                    <hr class="hori">
                    <p><b>The Data Value Chain</b>  is introduced to describe the information flow within a big data system as
                      a series of steps needed to generate value and useful insights from data. The Big Data Value Chain
                      identifies the following key high-level activities:
                        </p>
                        <h4> Data Acquisition</h4>
                        <hr class="hori">
                        <p>It is the process of gathering, filtering, and cleaning data before it is put in a data warehouse or any
                          other storage solution on which data analysis can be carried out. Data acquisition is one of the
                          major big data challenges in terms of infrastructure requirements. </p>
                            <h4>Data Analysis</h4>
                            <hr class="hori">
                            <p>It is concerned with making the raw data acquired amenable to use in decision-making as well as
                              domain-specific usage. Data analysis involves exploring, transforming, and modeling data with
                              the goal of highlighting relevant data, synthesizing and extracting useful hidden information with
                              high potential from a business point of view. Related areas include data mining, business
                              intelligence, and machine learning</p>
                              <h4>Data Curation</h4>
                            <hr class="hori">
                            <p>It is the active management of data over its life cycle to ensure it meets the necessary data quality
                              requirements for its effective usage. Data curation processes can be categorized into different
                              activities such as content creation, selection, classification, transformation, validation, and
                              preservation. Data curation is performed by expert curators that are responsible for improving the
                              accessibility and quality of data. <b>Data curators </b>(also known as scientific curators or data
                              annotators) hold the responsibility of ensuring that data are trustworthy, discoverable, accessible,
                              reusable and fit their purpose. A key trend for the duration of big data utilizes community and
                              crowdsourcing approaches. </p>
                              <h4>Data Storage</h4>
                              <hr class="hori">
                              <p>It is the persistence and management of data in a scalable way that satisfies the needs of
                                applications that require fast access to the data. Relational Database Management Systems
                                (RDBMS) have been the main, and almost unique, a solution to the storage paradigm for nearly
                                40 years. </p>
                                <h4>Data Usage</h4>
                                <hr class="hori">
                                <p>It covers the data-driven business activities that need access to data, its analysis, and the tools
                                  needed to integrate the data analysis within the business activity. Data usage in business decisionmaking can enhance competitiveness through the reduction of costs, increased added value, or any
                                  other parameter that can be measured against existing performance criteria. </p>

                                           <b> Big data </b> the term for a collection of data sets so large and complex that it becomes difficult to
                                            process using on-hand database management tools or traditional data processing applications.
                                            In this context, a “large dataset” means a dataset too large to reasonably process or store with
                                            traditional tooling or on a single computer. This means that the common scale of big datasets is
                                            constantly shifting and may vary significantly from organization to organization. Big data is
