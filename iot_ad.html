              <td><p>• Improved Customer Engagement − Current analytics suffer from blind-spots and
                significant flaws inaccuracy; and as noted, engagement remains passive. IoT completely
                transforms this to achieve richer and more effective engagement with audiences.</p></td>
              <td><p>• As the number of connected devices increases and more information is shared between
                devices, the potential that a hacker could steal confidential information also increases.</p></td>
                <td><p>• Security − IoT creates an ecosystem of constantly connected devices communicating over
                    networks. The system offers little control despite any security measures. This leaves users
                    exposed to various kinds of attackers.</p></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><p>• Technology Optimization − The same technologies and data which improve the customer
                experience also improve device use, and aid in more potent improvements to technology.
                IoT unlocks a world of critical functional and field data.</p></td>
              <td ><p>• If there’s a bug in the system, it’s likely that every connected device will become corrupted.</p></td>  
              <td><p>• Privacy − The sophistication of IoT provides substantial personal data in extreme detail
                without the user's active participation.</p>

            <tr>
              <td><p>• Reduced Waste − IoT makes areas of improvement clear. Current analytics give us
                superficial insight, but IoT provides real-world information leading to the more effective
                management of resources.</p></td>
              <td><p>• Since there’s no international standard of compatibility for IoT, it’s difficult for devices
                from different manufacturers to communicate with each other.</p></td>
                <td><p>
                • Complexity − Some find IoT systems complicated in terms of design, deployment, and
                maintenance given their use of multiple technologies and a large set of new enabling
                technologies.</p></td>

            <tr>
              <td><p>• Enhanced Data Collection − Modern data collection suffers from its limitations and its
                design for passive use. IoT breaks it out of those spaces and places it exactly where
                humans really want to go to analyze our world. It allows an accurate picture of everything.</p></td>
              <td><p>• Enterprises may eventually have to deal with massive numbers maybe even millions of IoT
                devices and collecting and managing the data from all those devices will be challenging.</p>
                </td>
                <td><p>• Flexibility − Many are concerned about the flexibility of an IoT system to integrate easily
                    with another. They worry about finding themselves with several conflicting or locking
                    systems.</p></td>

                <td ><p>• Compliance − IoT, like any other technology in the realm of business, must comply with
                    regulations. Its complexity makes the issue of compliance seem incredibly challenging
                    when many consider standard software compliance a battle.</p></td>
