                <b>Augmented reality (AR) </b>is a form of emerging technology that allows users to overlay computergenerated content in the real world. AR refers to a live view of a physical real-world environment
                whose elements are merged with augmented computer-generated images creating a mixed reality.
                The augmentation is typically done in real-time and in semantic context with environmental
                elements. <br><br>
                As a real-time direct or indirect view of a physical real-world
                  environment that has been enhanced/augmented by adding virtual computer-generated
               information to it.</div></div>

                    <b>VR</b> is fully immersive, which tricks your senses into thinking you’re in a different environment or
                    world apart from the real world. Using a head-mounted display (HMD) or headset, you’ll
                    experience a computer-generated world of imagery and sounds in which you can manipulate
                    objects and move around using haptic controllers while tethered to a console or PC. It is also called
                    
                    <b> a computer-simulated reality</b>. It refers to computer technologies using reality headsets to generate
                    realistic sounds, images and other sensations that replicate a real environment or create an
                    imaginary world. Advanced VR environment will engage all five senses (taste, sight, smell, touch,
                    sound), but it is important to say that this is not always possible .</div></div>

                           <b> Mixed Reality (MR)</b>, sometimes referred to as hybrid reality, is the merging of real and virtual
                                              worlds to produce new environments and visualizations where physical and digital objects co-exist
                                              and interact in real-time. It means placing new imagery within a real space in such a way that the
                                              new imagery is able to interact, to an extent, with what is real in the physical world we know</div></div>
