        <h3><b>Autonomic computing (AC)</b></h3>
        <hr class="hori">
       <p>  <b>Autonomic computing (AC) </b> an approach to address the complexity and evolution problems in
        software systems. It is a self-managing computing model named after, and patterned on, the human
        body's autonomic nervous system. An autonomic computing system would control the functioning
        of computer applications and systems without input from the user, in the same way, that the
        autonomic nervous system regulates body systems without conscious input from the individual. 
                        <br><br>
                        It refers to the self-managing characteristics of distributed resources, adapting to unpredictable
        changes while hiding intrinsic complexity to operators and users. Initiated by IBM in 2001, this
        initiative ultimately aimed to develop computer systems capable of self-management, to overcome
        the rapidly growing complexity of computing system management, and to reduce the barrier that
        complexity poses to further growth.

        <h4><b>Characteristics of Autonomic Systems</b></h4>
        <hr class="hori">
       <p>  <b>An autonomic system </b> can self-configure at runtime to meet changing operating environments, selftune to optimize its performance, self-heal when it encounters unexpected obstacles during its
        operation, and of particular current interest. Protect itself from malicious attacks. An autonomic
        system can self-manage anything including a single property or multiple properties.

           <ul>
               <li><p>Self-Awareness: An autonomic application/system “knows itself” and is aware of its state
                   and its behaviors.</p> </li>
               <li>Self-Configuring: An autonomic application/system should be able to configure and
                   reconfigure itself under varying and unpredictable conditions</li>
               <li>Self-Optimizing: An autonomic application/system should be able to detect suboptimal
                   behaviors and optimize itself to improve its execution.</li>
               <li>Self-Healing: An autonomic application/system should be able to detect and recover from
                   potential problems and continue to function smoothly</li>

           <ul>
               <li>Self-Protecting: An autonomic application/system should be capable of detecting and
                   protecting its resources from both internal and external attacks and maintaining overall
                   system security and integrity. </li>
               <li>Context-Aware: An autonomic application/system should be aware of its execution
                   environment and be able to react to changes in the environment. </li>
               <li>Open: An autonomic application/system must function in a heterogeneous world and
                   should be portable across multiple hardware and software architectures. Consequently, it
                   must be built on standard and open protocols and interfaces. </li>
               <li>Anticipatory: An autonomic application/system should be able to anticipate to the extent
                   possible, its needs and behaviors and those of its context, and be able to manage itself
                   proactively</li>
