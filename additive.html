        <h3><b>Additive manufacturing (3D Printing)</b></h3>
        <hr class="hori">
       <p>Are <b>“3D printing” and “additive manufacturing” (AM)</b>the same thing? In general, we know that
        terms stretch over time to include more than just their default meanings. Whatever the name, new
        ways of fabricating directly from bytes to stuff are radically changing the what, where, how, and
        when of making objects.

        <h3><b>3D Printing: It's All About the Printer</b></h3>
        <hr class="hori">
       <p>When MIT invented binder jet printing in the 1980s, they wrote:<b> “three-dimensional printing</b> is a
        process under development at MIT for the rapid and flexible production of prototype parts, enduse parts, and tools directly from a CAD model.”
        Today our concept of “3D printing” is much broader, but the term is often associated
        with filament-based plastic printers, which are the pride and joy of many a hobbyist and selfdescribed maker. But there are also binder jet printers, laser metal 3D printers, as well as glass and
        clay 3D printers

           <b> “Additive manufacturing” (AM)</b>is a big-picture term more at home in the boardroom than the
            factory floor or garage. Naturally, AM separates itself from older, subtractive technologies like
            milling. Otherwise, the term is less about the 3D printer itself, and more about the manufacturing
            process transformed by 3D printing.
            <br><br>
            <b>Additive manufacturing (AM)</b>describes types of advanced manufacturing that are used to create
            three-dimensional structures out of plastics, metals, polymers and other materials that can be
            sprayed through a nozzle or aggregated in a vat. These constructs are added layer by layer in realtime based on digital design. The simplicity and low cost of AM machines, combined with the
            scope of their potential creations, could profoundly alter global and local economies and affect
            international security.
