        <h3><b>Evolution of Technologies</b></h3>
        <hr class="hori">
        
        <p> <b>Emerging technology</b>   is a term generally used to describe a new technology, but it may also refer
          to the continuing development of existing technology; it can have slightly different meanings when
          used in different areas, such as media, business, science, or education. The term commonly refers
          to technologies that are currently developing, or that are expected to be available within the next
          five to ten years, and is usually reserved for technologies that are creating or are expected to create
          significant social or economic effects. Technological evolution is a theory of radical
          transformation of society through technological development.</p>
             
              
            <h4><b>What is the root word of technology and evolution?</b></h4>
            <hr class="hori"> 
            <ul>
              <li>
                  Technology: 1610s, "discourse or treatise on an art or the arts," from Greek tekhnologia
      "systematic treatment of an art, craft, or technique," originally referring to grammar, from
      tekhno- (see techno-) + -logy. The meaning "science of the mechanical and industrial
      arts" is first recorded in 1859.
               </li>
               <li>
                  Evolution: evolution means the process of developing by gradual changes. This noun is
      from Latin evolutio, "an unrolling or opening," combined from the prefix e-, "out," plus
      volvere, "to roll."

        <h4>Introduction to the Industrial Revolution (IR)</h4>
        <hr class="hori">
          <p> <b>The Industrial Revolution</b> was a period of major industrialization and innovation that took
            place during the late 1700s and early 1800s. An Industrial Revolution at its core occurs
            when a society shifts from using tools to make products to use new sources of energy, such
            as coal, to power machines in factories. The revolution started in England, with a series of
            innovations to make labor more efficient and productive. The Industrial Revolution was a
            time when the manufacturing of goods moved from small shops and homes to large
            factories. This shift brought about changes in culture as people moved from rural areas to
            big cities in order to work.</p>
           <h4><b> The four types of industries are:</b></h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The primary industry involves getting raw materials e.g. mining, farming, and fishing.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The secondary industry involves manufacturing e.g. making cars and steel.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Tertiary industries provide a service e.g. teaching and nursing.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The quaternary industry involves research and development industries e.g. IT.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Industrial Revolution (IR 1.0)</h4>
            <hr class="hori">
            <p><b>The Industrial Revolution (IR)</b> is described as a transition to new manufacturing processes. IR was
                first coined in the 1760s, during the time where this revolution began. The transitions in the first
                IR included going from hand production methods to machines, the increasing use of steam power
                , the development of machine tools and the rise of the factory system.
                </p>
                <h4>Industrial Revolution (IR 2.0)</h4>
                <hr class="hori">
                <p><b>The Second IR</b>, also known as the Technological Revolution, began somewhere in the 1870s. The
                    advancements in IR 2.0 included the development of methods for manufacturing interchangeable
                    parts and widespread adoption of pre-existing technological systems such as telegraph and railroad
                    networks. This adoption allowed the vast movement of people and ideas, enhancing
                    communication. Moreover, new technological systems were introduced, such as electrical power
                    and telephones.</p>
                    <h4>Industrial Revolution (IR 3.0)</h4>
                    <hr class="hori">
                    <p>Then came the <b>Third Industrial Revolution (IR 3.0)</b>. IR 3.0 introduced the transition from
                        mechanical and analog electronic technology to digital electronics (see Figure 1.3) which began
                        from the late 1950s. Due to the shift towards digitalization, IR 3.0 was given the nickname, “Digital
                        Revolution”. The core factor of this revolution is the mass production and widespread use of
                        digital logic circuits and its derived technologies such as the computer, handphones and the
                        Internet</p>
                        <h4>Fourth Industrial Revolution (IR 4.0)</h4>
                        <hr class="hori">
                        <p>Now, with advancements in various technologies such as robotics, Internet of Things , additive manufacturing and autonomous vehicles, the term <b>“Fourth Industrial
                            Revolution” </b>or IR 4.0 was coined by Klaus Schwab, the founder and executive chairman of World
                            Economic Forum, in the year 2016. The technologies mentioned above are what you call – cyberphysical systems. A cyber-physical system is a mechanism that is controlled or monitored by
                            computer-based algorithms, tightly integrated with the Internet and its users.</p>
