                 IoT device can be explained as a network of things that consists of hardware,
                  software, network connectivity, and sensors. Hence, the architecture of IoT devices comprises four
                  major components: sensing, network, data processing, and application layers.<br><br>
                  <b>1. Sensing Layer -</b> The main purpose of
                  the sensing layer is to identify any
                  phenomena in the devices’ peripheral
                  and obtain data from the real world.<br><br>

                            accumulate and forward sensor data to
                            the processing unit of a device.

                            example, shut off a power supply, adjust an airflow valve, or move a robotic gripper in an assembly process.

                          <b>A. Motion Sensors: </b>Motion sensors measure the change in motion as well as the orientation
                          of the devices. There are two types of motions one can observe in a device: linear and
                          angular motions. The linear motion refers to the linear displacement of an IoT device
                          while the angular motion refers to the rotational displacement of the device.

                              <b>B. Environmental Sensors: </b>Sensors such as Light sensors, Pressure sensors, etc. are
                                  embedded in IoT devices to sense the change in environmental parameters in the
                                  device’s peripheral. The primary purpose of using environmental sensors in IoT devices
                                  is to help the devices to take autonomous decisions according to the changes of a
                                  device’s peripheral. For instance, environment sensors are used in many applications to
                                  improve user experience (e.g., home automation systems, smart locks, smart lights, etc.).<br><br>

                                      <b>C. Position sensors:</b> Position sensors of IoT devices deal with the physical position and
                                          location of the device. The most common position sensors used in IoT devices are
                                          magnetic sensors and Global Positioning System (GPS) sensors. Magnetic sensors are
                                          usually used as digital compass and help to fix the orientation of the device display. On
                                          the other hand, GPS is used for navigation purposes in IoT devices.<br><br>

                                              <b>  2. Network Layer -</b> The network layer acts as a communication channel to transfer data, collected
                                                  in the sensing layer, to other connected devices. In IoT devices, the network layer is
                                                  implemented by using diverse communication technologies (e.g., Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, ZWave, LoRa, cellular network, etc.) to allow data flow between other devices within the same
                                                  network.<br><br>
                                                <b>  3. Data Processing Layer -</b> The data processing layer consists of the main data processing unit
                                                  of IoT devices. The data processing layer takes data collected in the sensing layer and analyses
                                                  the data to make decisions based on the result. In some IoT devices (e.g., smartwatch, smart
                                                  home hub, etc.), the data processing layer also saves the result of the previous analysis to
                                                  improve the user experience. This layer may share the result of data processing with other
                                                  connected devices via the network layer.<br><br>
                                                <b>  4. Application Layer -</b> The application layer implements and presents the results of the data
                                                  processing layer to accomplish disparate applications of IoT devices. The application layer is a
                                                  user-centric layer that executes various tasks for the users. There exist diverse IoT applications,
                                                  which include smart transportation, smart home, personal care, healthcare, etc.</p>
